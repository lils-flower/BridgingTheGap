      <h3> Hello everyone, I'm Nicole! I've had minimal prior coding experience before starting KWK's 2022 Web Development programme, though, it was just the basics in a few languages because I felt a bit uninspired by the way I was taught. I'm glad I stumbled across KWK on Instagram because it is so different to what I have experienced! I really hope this site has given you more information about computer science and inspires you too :) </h3>

      <h3> hi, i'm lamb!! if results day goes well, i am hoping to go to bristol university to study computer science despite not having taken it for a level or gcse. whilst trying to build my interest, i found it difficult to locate resources since the internet has such a vast selection and they are all located in different places! hence i hope this site helps collate them in one easy to access space to save you all time! </h3>

      <h3> Hi Everyone! My name is Lily and KWK was my first ever coding experience. I am always open to learning new things and coding is one of them, that's why I signed up for KWK and I am thrilled to have done that. At first, I found coding difficult, but by time it got easier and easier. I am hoping to continue learning more about coding, get more into CS and maybe study it in college.</h3>
