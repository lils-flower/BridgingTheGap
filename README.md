# </bridging the gap>
This repository host the coding project "</bridging the gap>" which I created in collaboration with three other Kode With Klossy scholars as our final project for the Kode With Klossy 2022 Virtual Website Development Summer Camp. 
Our website provides resources for people who want to learn more about Computer Science, whether they are new to the fields and have zero knowledge about it, changing careers, from a disadvantaged background or considered a minority. 
These resources include courses, summer camps and youtube channels. 
## Our Goals: 
We created this website with the aim of bringing more diversity to the field of Computer Science. We want to share resources and increase accessibility, creating a website that provides guidance, creates interst and enhances the knowledge of the field by providing a one-stop-hub for various resources.
We collected resources that will help you, whether you like to learn alone or in groups, virtually or in-person, etc. 
Don't forget to hover on the pictures to discover more information about CS!
## Architecture: 
We created this website starting with creating a wireframe using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). 
We then started coding the website itself on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) using the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
