    <h2> What is CS exactly? </h2>
<!--     first paragraph start -->
    <section class="paragraphs">
    <p> CS (Computer Science) is the study of computers and computational systems. There are many aspects that come under the CS umbrella, including: Artificial Intelligence, Computer Systems and Networks, Database Systems, Security, Human Computer Interaction, Vision and Graphics, Application Development, Numerical Analysis, Programming languages, Software engineering, Bioinformatics and Theory of computing. These are the principal areas of study within the field.</p>

      <p> So you might ask yourself, why is this study and it's fields important? </p>
      <p> Well, let us answer this important question. All the of the technology you use was created by computer scientists whos studied CS. Without them and without this study none of it would have even existed.</p>

    <h2> What are the benefits of CS? </h2>

      <div class="text">
      <p>CS is a challenging yet rewarding career path. Of course you're asking yourself now: WHY?
      Well here is the answer:</p>
      <p>Computer scientists are problem solvers. When computer scientists receive a problem, they gather information and communicate with computers using programming languages and logic (e.g. scripting). They create a set of rules or instructions for the computer to execute and solve the problem. Also, the curriclulum is not easy, yet it is not impossible and if you are a life-long learner and if you work hard, you will get the hang of it.Further, we live in a world that heavily relies on technology so there is clearly a need for computer science-related technical skills as companies upgrade their business models. CS offers a great variety of job opportunities with great sallary.</p>
